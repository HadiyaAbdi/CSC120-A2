Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

This assignment ultimately worked out for me. While I initially understood the task, I ran into an issue where my code wasnâ€™t printing anything, which caused some confusion. After some troubleshooting and making a few changes, I was able to resolve the issue. My advice for future students is to collaborate with peers early on and start the assignment in advance, so you have enough time to seek help during office hours if needed.
