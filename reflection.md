What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Following the instruction worked somewhat for me. i understood what the assignemnt asked for but for some reason my code isnt printing anything out. That made me confused and i started changing things which made me even more confused. i will suggest for somebody who is taking this in the future maybe to work with your peers and start ahead so you can have time to go to the student hours.
